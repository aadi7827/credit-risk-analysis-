# 🏦 Credit Risk Analysis - EDA Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world financial dataset to uncover insights related to **loan payment difficulties**. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that affect credit risk and borrower behavior.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Credit_Risk__Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step EDA and visualizations.
- `application_data.csv`: Contains details of loan applicants.
- `previous_application.csv`: Past loan application records.
- `columns_description.csv`: Metadata for the columns in the dataset.
- `Loan_Default_EDA_Project_Presentation.pptx`: Presentation summarizing the project findings.

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify client characteristics linked to loan defaults.
- Understand the demographic, financial, and historical loan behavior of applicants.
- Provide business insights that help minimize lending risk.

## 📊 Key Analyses

- **Univariate Analysis**: Age, income, credit amount distributions.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships between features and the `TARGET` variable (default).
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identifying top predictors of loan default.
- **Merged Insights**: Combined analysis with previous application data.

## 🔍 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 💡 Key Insights

- Younger clients and those with lower income levels show higher default risk.
- Previous loan application status is a good predictor of future default.
- Certain education and occupation types are more prone to risk.

## 📝 Business Recommendations

- Use risk indicators to enhance loan approval models.
- Give additional scrutiny to high-risk demographics.
- Leverage historical behavior to improve creditworthiness scoring.
